Name of the Game: Daemongel

Team: Danny Wong and Yassine Zaabat

Type of Game: Third-Person Action/Puzzle

The game will follow a Demon from Hell as he is sent to Heaven to battle the forces of Good in order to assimilate both worlds into one. 
As he progresses he will find himself in a fight with God himself and will repent for his sins and discover his destiny. 
The game will include third-person combat and puzzle elements. 
We will use the Asset store and design the levels ourselves. 
The goal here is to make a finished prototype that’s easy on the eyes and functional.
